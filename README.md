## Steps Taken

* Created repo in GitLab
* Deployed site
* I pseudocoded what was required for the assignment in plain english
* I used information from class to find the total months in the array and the total profit/loss net amount
* After extensive research and trying to understand how to pull the data needed for the average changes
    * I enlisted the help of a tutor **"Sara Neves Pereira"** to help with the assignment and unfortunately, I'm none the wiser as to why I was able to get the average amount and how this information was pulled from the array.
I was given code to write with zero explanation for their use and how the information would be pulled from it
* I'm really struggling with this assignment and can't wrap my head around how to code to retrieve the information requested.
* All code after Net Amount of Profit/Loss was provided by Tutor
* I'll continue to play around with the code until I understand it
