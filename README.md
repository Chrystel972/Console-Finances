## Task - Challenge 3

Create an algorithm using javascript that pulls required information from dataset presented in starter code provided by learning provider.

### GITHUB REPO - https://github.com/Chrystel972/Console-Finances.git
### DEPLOYED APP - https://chrystel972.github.io/Console-Finances/

## Steps Taken

* Created repo in GitLab
* Deployed site
* I pseudocoded what was required for the assignment in plain english
* I used information from class to find the total months in the array and the total profit/loss net amount
* I enlisted the help of a tutor "Sara Neves Pereira" to help with the assignment and unfortunately, I'm none the wiser as to why I was able to get the average amount and how this information was pulled from the array.
I was given code to write with zero explanation for their use and how the information would be pulled from it
* I'm really struggling with this assignment and can't wrap my head around how to code to retrieve the information requested.


<!-- Create a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, clone it to your computer.

Copy the starter files in your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/(Number of months - 1))
The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period. -->
